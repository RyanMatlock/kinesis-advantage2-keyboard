# Personal configuration files for Kinesis Advantage2 Keyboard

To use (at least on Mac), connect keyboard as USB storage device by first
enabling Power User Mode with `PROGM + SHIFT + ESC`, then connect the v-Drive
with `PROGM + F1`. From there, copy the desired configuration files to
`/Volumes/ADVANTAGE2/active/`.
